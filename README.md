# ⚡ Boat Battery & Bilge Monitoring System (ESPHome + ESP32)

**A smart marine monitoring node for real-time battery, bilge, and temperature data**
Built on **ESPHome**, this system continuously tracks **voltage, current, temperature, and bilge water level**.

## 🌐 System Communication Overview

The system communicates over **Wi-Fi** to a remote **Home Assistant** instance via a **Nabu Casa webhook**, sending JSON data for key parameters.  

- The Wi-Fi ESPHome code includes **redundant SSID failover capabilities**.  
  - This allows seamless switching between **marina Wi-Fi** and a **mobile hotspot** when away.  
- The webhook is protected by a **user-generated security token** for secure communication.  

### 🔄 Communication Paths

There are two main data transmission paths:

1. **Interval Path** – Communicates every **2 minutes** for regular status updates.  
2. **Alarm Path** – Communicates **immediately** for urgent events (e.g., bilge alarm or fault status).  

### 🚨 Important Home Assistant Automation Alerts

The following automations provide critical safety and diagnostic alerts:

- ⚠️ **High Water Alert** – Bilge float switch triggered  
- 🕒 **No Communication for 30 Minutes** – Possible Wi-Fi loss or device failure  
- 🌡️ **High Temperature Alert** – Abnormal temperature rise detected  
- 🔋 **Low Battery Voltage Alert** – Voltage drop below safe operating range

## 🧱 3D Printing Instructions

1. **Import the model** into your slicer (e.g., *PrusaSlicer*, *Cura*, *Bambu Studio*).  
2. Once loaded, **right-click** the model and choose **“Separate”** or **“Break Apart Parts.”**  
   - This allows you to print the **top cover**, **base**, and **mounting plate** individually.  
   - Each part can then be **positioned flat** on the bed for best adhesion and surface quality.  
3. Verify that each part is oriented correctly and scaled to **100%** before slicing.  
4. Use **supports only where needed** (around screw posts or overhangs).  
5. **Recommended settings:**
   - Layer height: `0.2 mm`  
   - Infill: `20–30%`  
   - Material: **PETG** or **ASA** for marine durability and UV resistance.

## 🧩 Overview

This project provides a reliable, remotely monitored **boat power management and bilge alert system**.
It integrates precision current and voltage sensors, waterproof temperature sensing, and Wi-Fi telemetry — all powered by a protected 5 V supply controlled by a rugged stainless-steel **mechanical ON/OFF button**.

When the button is latched **ON**, 5 V flows to the ESP32 and the system boots automatically.
When toggled **OFF**, it completely disconnects power, ensuring **zero quiescent draw** during storage.

## 🔌 Power & Wiring Overview

### ⚡ Power Distribution

1. **Boat Battery (12 V / 24 V)**
   Supplies power to the **PlusRoc DC-DC Step-Down Module**.

2. **PlusRoc DC-DC Converter**

   * Input: 12 – 24 V DC
   * Output: 5 V @ up to 3 A
   * Feeds the ESP32 and all sensors.

3. **Stainless-Steel Push Button Switch**

   * Wired **inline with the +5 V output** of the DC-DC converter.
   * When pressed **ON** (latched), 5 V passes to the ESP32 VIN pin.
   * When pressed **OFF**, the circuit opens and fully powers down the system.
   * Add a small hole in printed case cover to see ESP32 power LED.

### 🔧 Wiring Summary

## 🪛 Installation Notes

* Mount the **stainless-steel button** in a visible, easily accessible location.
* Add a small hole in the case cover so you can visibly see the ESP32 power LED.
* Rated at **2 A @ 12 V/24 V DC**, sufficient for the ESP32 and small sensor loads.
* For marine safety, use **heat-shrink butt connectors** or **waterproof crimp terminals**.
* Optionally add a **fuse (500 mA–1 A)** between converter and switch for circuit protection.

## 💻 Firmware

The project’s ESPHome configuration (`mercury-engine-battery.yaml`) defines:

* Dual INA226 sensors for battery banks
* ADC current measurement (Hall effect)
* DS18B20 and ESP internal temperature
* Bilge float-switch alerting via webhook

  "voltage": "12.63",
  "current": "1.84",
  "voltage2": "12.61",
  "temp": "70.8",
  "bilgealarm": "OFF",
  "wifi": "DockNetwork",
  "wifirssi": "-61",
  "esptemp": "95.4"
}
```
